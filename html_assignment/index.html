        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is <em>KHALED</em> and I am currently a student at 
            <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. im 28 its my second year in canada im here to get one of dream diplome canadian im very interested in this program because i like creativity and may be one day i become one of the greatest designer in the world  
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I love photography and exploring nature. These hobbies inspire me creatively 
            and help me approach design from a fresh perspective. I believe in lifelong learning and always strive 
            to improve my skills. In fact, I dedicate at least an hour each day to self-improvement, whether it's 
            reading, coding, or practicing mindfulness. I live by the saying that “practice makes perfect,” and I 
            apply that principle to every aspect of my life.
